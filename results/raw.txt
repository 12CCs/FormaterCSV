Abstract
Spreading the ideas and announcing new discoveries and ﬁndings in the scientiﬁc world
is typically realized by publishing and reading scientiﬁc literature. Within the past few
decades we have witnessed digital revolution, which moved scholarly communication to
electronic media and also resulted in a substantial increase in its volume. Nowadays keep-
ing track with the latest scientiﬁc achievements poses a major challenge for the researchers.
Scientiﬁc information overload is a severe problem that slows down scholarly communica-
tion and knowledge propagation across the academia.
Modern research infrastructures facilitate studying scientiﬁc literature by providing
intelligent search tools, proposing similar and related documents, building and visualizing
interactive citation and author networks, assessing the quality and impact of the articles
using citation-based statistics, and so on. In order to provide such high quality services
the system requires the access not only to the text content of stored documents, but also
to their machine-readable metadata. Since in practice good quality metadata is not always
available, there is a strong demand for a reliable automatic method of extracting machine-
readable metadata directly from source documents.
Our research addresses these problems by proposing an automatic, accurate and ﬂexible
algorithm for extracting wide range of metadata directly from scientiﬁc articles in born-
digital form. Extracted information includes basic document metadata, structured full
text and bibliography section.
Designed as a universal solution, proposed algorithm is able to handle a vast variety
of publication layouts with high precision and thus is well-suited for analyzing heteroge-
neous document collections.
This was achieved by employing supervised and unsuper-
vised machine-learning algorithms trained on large, diverse datasets. The evaluation we
conducted showed good performance of proposed metadata extraction algorithm.
The
comparison with other similar solutions also proved our algorithm performs better than
competition for most metadata types.
Proposed method is a reliable and accurate solution to the problem of extracting the
metadata from documents. It allows modern research infrastructures to provide intelligent
tools and services supporting the process of consuming the growing volume of scientiﬁc
literature by the readers, which results in facilitating the communication among the sci-
entists and the overall improvement of the knowledge propagation and the quality of the
research in the scientiﬁc world.
